Hi this is Yulong, and welcome to my site.
</p>

<p>
Currently a software engineer at Google (NYC), previously at Foursquare Labs (NYC) and Uber (SF). Before that, I studied the intersection of human computer interaction and security at Rutgers University. I was born and raised in Chengdu, China.

I am interested in solving practical problems by building softwares, as well as discovering insights from data. I am also trying to get better at it.

The site is under construction and more content coming soon. Meanwhile, feel free to check out some very old blogs or my contacts.
