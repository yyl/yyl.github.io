So eventually I am making a Flask app in virtual environment, and hosted by gunicorn and Nginx. I do not want to explain why I chose so, and I do not want to detail my steps of setting them up either. Because there are already many posts on why you should do so and how. 

Instead, I will include in thie post here some problems I met and did not find any solutions online, in hope of somebody else meet the same problem in the future, they could have a place to refer to at least. Also, I include some tricks I find handy to use in this deployment.
