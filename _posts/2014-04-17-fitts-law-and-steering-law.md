**The problem** Fitts' law is good for HCI study, but only fit for one specific scenario: 

**The solution** extend Fitts' law to cover the performance evaluation of trajectory-based tasks. The authors give mathematical equations derived from Fitts' law to characterize the task under four different conditions. The process is in form of four different experiments.

### What is Fitts' law
